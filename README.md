This is the page for our group project for BIS 015L, **Introduction to Data Science for Biologists** at UC Davis during the Winter 2023 quarter.

This repository will be filled with our work on this project, which is a culmination of the work we have done this quarter using the R software environment.

You can contact us through [email](mailto:taaaguilar@ucdavis.edu) and find our slideshow [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFcvN98Sug/P3PwLPbwjEwYv_Ms5PvHaw/view?utm_content=DAFcvN98Sug&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink)
